# EmployeeMS
Employee database Management System, in python w SQL, and Tkinter<BR>
<BR>
This project, is a proof of concept that hones my ability to work with both SQL and Python simultaneously by integrating SQL databases with python, and adding a simple GUI through the use of the tkinter python module.<BR>
<BR>
Features include: Creating, Reading, Updtaing, and Deleting data from an SQL database.<BR>
<BR>
Note that the code is currently set to connect to a local mySQL server so in order for it to function on your computer you must also install a client sided mysql server, or connect the code to an online database.
